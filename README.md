# MuConvee
### As of March 9th, 2026, Spotify is preventing all developers without a Spotify premium account from accessing their web api. As I do not want to pay for premium, Muconvee will cease development for the forseeable future.
An (in development) locally run, open-source streaming service playlist converter.
On first release, will support playlists being converted from Apple Music to Spotify.

~~### Todo for v1.0~~
~~- Link Spotify API key with the rest of the API calls~~
~~- Add Apple Music Functionality~~
~~- Link all of the Services Together~~
